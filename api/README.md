Tasks:

Gather data from an API

Write a Python script that retrieves TODO list progress for a given employee ID from a REST API. Display employee's progress and completed tasks in a specific format.

Export to CSV

Extend the script from Task 0 to export data in CSV format. CSV format: "USER_ID","USERNAME","TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS","TASK_TITLE"

Export to JSON

Extend the script from Task 0 to export data in JSON format. JSON format: {"USER_ID": [{"task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS, "username": "USERNAME"}, ...]} File name: USER_ID.json

Dictionary of list of dictionaries

Extend the script from Task 0 to export data for all employees in JSON format. JSON format: {"USER_ID": [{"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ...]} File name: todo_all_employees.json

By completing these tasks, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python scripting, API usage, and data manipulation techniques, essential for modern system administration and SRE roles.
